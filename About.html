            <p>In 1958, two Texas brothers opened the first Pizza Arena across from the Southern Methodist University campus in Dallas, TX.<br>
              As word spread of the restaurant’s exceptional pizza and friendly service, so did Pizza Inn locations.<br>
              From 1960–1990, taste buds across the southeastern and southwestern U.S. were able to experience first–hand <br>
              the made–from–scratch crispy, crackery Original Thin crust, and tangy signature sauce that are still hallmarks of the Pizza Arena <br>
              brand today. Throughout its 50-year history, Pizza Arena has prided itself on freshness and innovation, introducing the Taco Pizza <br>
              in 1979, the first dessert “pizzert” pizza in 1986 and the chain’s hallmark bacon cheeseburger pizza by the 1990s. <br>
              In 1994, Pizza Arena was named the #1 Pizza Chain in the U.S. by Restaurants and Institutions magazines annual “America's Choice in Chains”<br> 
              consumer poll. And today, Pizza Inn, headquartered in the Dallas area, operates more than 310 restaurants domestically and internationally, <br>
              with several new stores scheduled to open in the next year. It’s been a privilege serving loyal guests for more than three generations.<br>
